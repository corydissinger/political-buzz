:Goal of this Rails App

	To display data from the Washington Post Issues Engine API and NPR Story API. I would prefer to
	not 'bother' the API's for every request a user makes - instead I would like to copy all the data
	to a relational database on the server which this app would run on. 
	
:To-Do List

	1. Auto-suggest box on topics view which uses an ajax call to render statements on the same page.
	2. Clicking on a statement brings you to the details page
	3. A 'back button' on the details page returns you to the 'home' page with the same category rendered
